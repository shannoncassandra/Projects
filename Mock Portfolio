yfinance is not the same library as yahoo-finance

Yahoo-finance seems to be outdated and maybe that's why it's not working 


YFinance is a shortcut library to skim Yahoo web data and not Yahoo API
You still can use it but you can do way more with Pandas and Requests but it 
will take time for you to learn how to look up tags in webcode. 

Working example 
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

import yfinance as yf
stockname="IBM" 

stock = yf.Ticker(stockname)

print(stock.splits)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
